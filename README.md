## 📚 Overview

**UAV Spoofing Detection** is an AI/ML-powered system designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  
Spoofing attacks can manipulate GPS signals or communication systems, posing serious threats to UAV operations.  
This project builds a robust, scalable, and intelligent solution to safeguard UAV missions.
